# dotfiles
Current dotfiles for the things I enjoy on my system.

## theme changing script
.wal.sh is my theme changing script. I have it aliased as `theme`
Check the contents for "dependencies" or edit it to your liking so it suits your system.

## edit appropriately to suit your system
If you use any of my dot files, be sure to replace $HOME/ with the direct path on your system.
ie: /home/user/

For waybar-wttr.py and the weather script in waybar>custom, replace City with the city or town you want weather information from.
