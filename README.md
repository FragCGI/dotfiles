# dotfiles
Current dotfiles for the things I enjoy on my system.

If you use any of my dot files, be sure to replace $HOME/ with the direct path on your system.
ie: /home/user/

For waybar-wttr.py and the weather script in waybar>custom, replace City with the city or town you want weather information from.
